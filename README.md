Mini Project: Student Performance Analysis

This project showcases the use of **Python and Pandas** for cleaning, exploring, and analyzing a real-world dataset of student scores.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains test scores of students in **Math, English, and Science**, along with **Gender**, **Attendance**, and **Grade**. It includes missing values and inconsistent data, making it ideal for practicing data cleaning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Read CSV data using Pandas
- 🧹 Clean data (handle NaN, replace invalid entries)
- 📈 Convert % attendance to float
- ➕ Add new columns (Total Score, Average Score)
- 📊 Analyze using `groupby()`, `agg()`, `sort_values()`
- 🏆 Identify top performers
- 💾 Export cleaned dataset to a new CSV file

---

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced

- `pd.read_csv()`, `df.replace()`, `df.fillna()`
- `df['col'].str.replace()`, type conversion
- `groupby()`, `agg()`, filtering
- Adding new columns from calculations
- Sorting and exporting DataFrames

---

## 🔍 Results Summary

- Cleaned and standardized all missing/inconsistent data.
- Calculated total and average marks for each student.
- Grouped students by gender and subject for analysis.
- Identified the top performers.
- Final cleaned dataset exported to `cleaned_student_scores.csv`.
