# Mini-Project-Student-Performance-Analysis-Using-Pandas-
Over the past few days, I completed a hands-on mini project focused on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing student performance data using the powerful Pandas library in Python.

🔍 Project Highlights:

✅ Loaded and explored messy real-world data
✅ Cleaned missing/inconsistent values using mean & median
✅ Converted percentage attendance to numerical values
✅ Created new columns for Total and Average scores
✅ Grouped data by Gender to compare performance
✅ Identified top performers using sorting techniques
✅ Exported the final cleaned data to a new CSV for future use

🛠️ Skills Applied:

Data cleaning (NaN, string replacement)

groupby(), agg(), sort_values(), apply()

Filtering, indexing, and value transformation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Real-life dataset handling with Pandas

💡 This project not only strengthened my Pandas skills but also gave me confidence in applying them to real-world scenarios.
